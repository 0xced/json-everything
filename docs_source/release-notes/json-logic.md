# [1.1.0](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/62)

Prematurely released library.  It would parse and process fine, but the factory methods for building inline logic were incomplete.  Also added XML comments for everything.

# [1.0.1](https://github.com/gregsdennis/json-everything/pull/61)

Signed the DLL for strong name compatibility.

# 1.0.0

Initial release.

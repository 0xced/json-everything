## API Documentation Generator

This tool builds Markdown API Documentation that is ultimately synced to the documentation repository and displayed as API Reference docs on https://docs.json-everything.net.

The source for these documents is the code itself, including the XML comments present across the public API for each library.  To update the API documentation, the code needs to be updated.

Issues and PRs are welcome in this repository to update these.

Other documentation issues, questions, and proposals should be made in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything-docs).
